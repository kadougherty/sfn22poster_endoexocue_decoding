# sfn22poster_endoexocue_decoding

This poster was presented at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in November 2022.

Here we test whether neuron populations in 3 regions within the primate attention network
(FEF, LIP, and medio-dorsal pulvinar) represent behaviorally relevant visual locations
following the presentation of exogenous (salient) and endogenous (learned, goal-directed) 
cues. We approach this aim by training machine learning classifiers on the firing rates of neurons 
in the population when cues (endogenous or exogenous) are presented to the left or right hemifield, and assess model 
performance on data from held-out trials. We take model performance as an indicator of how much information
about cue location is present in these populations throughout an attention task.
